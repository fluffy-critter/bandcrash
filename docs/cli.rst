Using the CLI
=============

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install the CLI is using ``pipx``::

   pipx install bandcrash

See ``bandcrash --help`` for detailed help on the CLI.

Album setup
-----------

You can bootstrap an album JSON file with::

   bandcrash --init input_dir

where ``input_dir`` is where you've kept a bunch of .wav files for your album tracks. This will generate a file named ``album.json`` by default, although you can override this name using the ``--json`` parameter.

Next, see :doc:`the metadata format <metadata>` for additional information on what goes inside this JSON file.

Note that ``.bcalbum`` files generated by the GUI will also work with the CLI; I highly recommend using the CLI in this way.

Encoding
--------

Run Bandcrash with::

   bandcrash input_dir/album.json output_dir

and it will automatically encode the album based on its settings and, if so configured, upload to itch.io. This will also work with ``.bcalbum`` files (which are just JSON with a different extension), e.g.::

    bandcrash 'music/my album/my album.bcalbum' output_dir

If you want to override the encoder arguments, remember to put them in quotes; for example::

   bandcrash --mp3-encoder-args="-q:3 -joint_stereo:0"

Output formats are mostly enabled by default, aside from CD authoring files, which must be enabled with ``--cdda`` or by setting the ``"cdda"`` flag in the album definition file. You can always force a format to be generated or not generated with e.g. ``--mp3``, ``--no-mp3``, and so on.

Uploading to itch
-----------------

If you plan on uploading your albums to `itch.io <https://itch.io>`_, it is highly recommended that you install `butler <https://itch.io/docs/butler/>`_ (ideally from `the itch app <https://itch.io/app>`_). After doing this, add ``butler`` to your path (either by adding its directory to your ``PATH`` environment variable or by putting a symlink to the binary somewhere useful). You can also specify the Butler path at runtime using ``--butler-path``.

.. TIP::
   If you're using the Itch app, you can find the binary by going to Butler in your library, clicking the gear icon, then selecting "Manage" and looking at the ``Show in Finder/Explorer`` button.

After that, run ``butler login`` to connect Butler to itch.
